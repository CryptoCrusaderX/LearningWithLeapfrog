I'll be using this repo to document my **#60DaysOfLearning** journey, where I can track my progress, stay consistent, and reflect along the way.

## Day 1/60

**Object Oriented Programming** is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which represent real-world entities.



### Key Ideas of OOP
- **Classes**
- **Object**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**



### Class

A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines **attributes** (properties) and **methods** (behaviours) that objects will have.

**Components of Class:**
- **Attributes**: Data members that store the state or properties of the object.
- **Methods**: Functions inside a class that define the behaviour of the object.
- **Constructor**(`__init__`): A special method used to initialize attributes when an object is created.


### Object

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with specific **properties** (attributes) and **behaviours** (methods).

### Inheritance
Inheritance is a feature of OOP that allows one class (child/derived class) to acquire attributes and methods from another class (parent/base) class. It  helps establish a hierarchical relationship between classes.

### Key ideas of Inheritance
- `super()` <br>
A function used to call a method or constructor from the parent class.
- Method Overriding <br>
When a method in the child class has the same name as one in the parent class, the child's method overrides the parent's method.
