# 60DaysOfLearning2025

I'll be using this repo to document my **#60DaysOfLearning** journey, where I can track my progress, stay consistent, and reflect along the way.I'll start from learning OOP in python.

## Day 1/60

**Object Oriented Programming** is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which represent real-world entities.



### Key Ideas of OOP
- **Classes**
- **Object**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**



### Class

A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines **attributes** (properties) and **methods** (behaviours) that objects will have.

**Components of Class:**
- **Attributes**: Data members that store the state or properties of the object.
- **Methods**: Functions inside a class that define the behaviour of the object.
- **Constructor**(`__init__`): A special method used to initialize attributes when an object is created.


### Object

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with specific **properties** (attributes) and **behaviours** (methods).

## Day 2/60

### Inheritance
Inheritance is a feature of OOP that allows one class (child/derived class) to acquire attributes and methods from another class (parent/base) class. It  helps establish a hierarchical relationship between classes.

### Key ideas of Inheritance
- `super()` <br>
A function used to call a method or constructor from the parent class.
- Method Overriding <br>
When a method in the child class has the same name as one in the parent class, the child's method overrides the parent's method.

### Types of Inheritance
- Single Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance
- Multi-Level Inheritance
- Hierarchical Inheritance 
- Hybrid Inheritance

### Single Inheritance
Single Inheritance is a scenario where there is only one Base(parent) class and only one Derived (Child) class.

### Multiple Inheritance
In multiple Inheritance a single child (derived) class is derived from two parent(base) class.

---

## Day 3/60
- In multiple inheritance, if both parent classes have a method with the same name, however, if we want to call a specific method from one of the parent classes, we can do it by explicitly calling the method from the parent class, passing self as an argument.

### Multi-Level Inheritance
Mutli-Level Inheritance is the type of inheritance in which a class inherits from a class, which itself inherits from another class.__(Grandparent--Parent--Children)classe__
- We can directly access method of Grandparent class from child class method by calling it explicitly by using the `name of grandparent-class.method`

__or__
- We can acess the method of grandparent class from method of parent class using `super()` method; and method of child using `super()` method.

### Hierarchical Inheritance
Hierarchical Inheritance is the type of inheritance in which a single class is inherited by multiple derived classes.

---
## Day 4/60
### Hybrid Inheritance

Hybrid Inheritance is a blend of multiple inheritance types.In hybrid inheritance, the classes are derived from more than one base class, creating a complex inheritance structure.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation combines two things:
- Data (Attributes): Properties that hold the state of the object
- Methods: Functions that define the behaviour of the object

### Access Specifiers in python 

__Public Attributes:__
- Accessible from anywhere
- No Special Syantax required(default).

__Protected Attributes:__
- Indicated by `_attribute` (single underscore)
- A Convention: Indented for internal use only but still accessible

__Private Attributes:__
- Indicated by `__attribute` (double underscore)
- Python uses name mangling to make this attributes harder to access directly.

__Getter and Setter:__

A getter and setter are methods used to access and update the attributes of class.
- _Getter_: The getter method is used to retrieve the value of private attribute. it allows controlled acess to the attribute
- _Setter_: The setter method is used to set or modify the value of a private attribute. It allows us to control how the value is updated, enabling validation or modification of data before it's actually assigned.

There is also an buit-in property to simplify the creating of getters and setters.

---
## Day 5/60
__Property Decorator__
- an pythonic way to define getters and setters and.
- Works like property() but uses decorator for cleaner code.

__Name Mangling__
- Python uses Name Mangling to make private attributes harder to access but not impossible. You can access them using `_ClassName_attribute`
- Generally, this method is not recommended cause it voilates the purpose of encapsulation

__Public Method__
- Methods that can be accessed from anywhere, including outside the class.(default methods)
- Name Convention: Public Methods do not use any special prefix

__Protected Method__
- Methods intended for internal use by the class and it's related code. However, they can still be accessed by from outside the class.
- Naming Convention: Protected Methods starts with a single underscore (`_`)

*Acessing Private Method*
- Using  Public Methods that Internally calls Private Methods, This ensures that private methods remains hidden while serving their indented purpose.

## Day 6/60

Solved Inheritance and Encapsulation based questions, which helped me understand concept more cleary.

## Day 7/60

### Polymorphism
The terms "Polymorphism" means "many form".<br>
Polymorphism is a key concept in OOP, which allows objects of different class to respond to the same method call in different ways. It simplies code and and enhances flexiblity by enabling a single interface to represent different underlying forms(data types). 

### Types of Polymorphism:-

__Compile-Time Polymorphism:__
- Achieved using method overloading and operator overloading
- Allows Methods/Operators to behave differently based on their inputs

__Run-Time Polymorphism:__
- Achieved using method overiding
- The behaviour of a method is determined at runtime based on object's type.

### Method Overloading

Method Overloading allows a class to define multiple methods with the same name but different argument lists.It enables method to behave differently based on the number or type of arguments passed.

Python does not support traditional method overloading like other programming language such as  Java or C++. In python:
- The latest defined method with the same name will overwrite the earlier ones
- However, we can achieve similar behaviour using default arguments, variable lenghts arguments(`*args`and `**kwargs`) or type checking

__Type Checking__

Type Checking in Python refers to verifying the data type of variables, object  or a value, either at runtime or (optionally) during static analysis.

---
## Day 8/60

### Operator Overloading
- Operating overloading in python allows us to define custom behaviour for standard operators (like +,-,*).Which they are used with objects of user-defined classes. It is implemented by overriding special methods, also known as dunder(double underscore) methods.

- Python uses special methods (dunder methods) to implement operator behaviour. These methods are predefined in python and can be overriden in classes.

### Overloading built-in methods
- Overloading built-in methods allows us to redefine the behaviour of python's built-in functions when used with objects of custom classes. This is achieved by overriding special methods (dunder methods) in class.

*Why over-load built-in Methods*?
- Custom Behaviour
- Intiutive Use
- Enhanced Functionality

### Duck Typing in Python
- Duck Typing is a programming concept in Python where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods and properties it defines.The term originates from saying:
*"If it Looks Like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a dog, then it is a dog".*

- In Python, this means that an object's suitability for a task is determined by whether it has necessary methods or attributes, rather than it's specific types.

---
## Day 9/60

### Polymorphism with inheritance (Method Overiding)

- Polymorphism with inheritance, achieved through method overiding, allows a subclass to redefine or extend the behaviour of a method defined in it's parent class. This enables objects of different classes to respond differently to the same method call.
- The method in the subclass should have the same name, parameters and return type as the one in the parent class.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential functionality to the user. Focues on __"What"__ an object does, not __"how"__ it does.

#### Abstraction is Achieved Through

__1. Abstract Classes:__
- Classes that act as blueprints
- Can't be instantiated directly

__2. Abstract Methods:__
- Methods that are declared but not implemented in the abstract class.
- Must be implemented by subclasses.

__3. Key Python Tools:__
- abc module (Abstract Base Class)
- @abstractmethod decorator
---

## Day 10/60

__Abstract Class__

- An abstract class is a blueprint for other classes.It defines the structure but does not provide full implementation

- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. They are designed to be inherited by subclasses.

- They help enforce a contract for the derived classes to implement specific methods.

__Abstract Method__

- An abstract method is a method declared in an abstract class but without any implementation.

- It serves as a placeholder, mandating a subclasses to provide their own implementation. 

- Abstract methods are defined using the @abstractmethod decorator.

## Day 11/60
__Solved Abstraction Based Question__

## Day 12/60
### Metaclasses

The classes that generate other classes are defined as metclasses, as well as the classes that inherit directly from type.

__Now what is type?__<br>
The Exact class that is used for class instantiation is called type.

__MetaClass Usecases__
- Class Verification
- Prevent Inheriting the attributes
- Dynamic Generation of classes 
--- 

## Day 13/60

Solved tow usecases of MetaClass i.e Prevent Inheriting the attributes and Dynamic Generation of classes
