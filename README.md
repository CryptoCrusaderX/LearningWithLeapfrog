**Object Oriented Programming** is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which represent real-world entities.



### Key Ideas of OOP
- **Classes**
- **Object**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**



### Class

A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines **attributes** (properties) and **methods** (behaviours) that objects will have.

**Components of Class:**
- **Attributes**: Data members that store the state or properties of the object.
- **Methods**: Functions inside a class that define the behaviour of the object.
- **Constructor**(`__init__`): A special method used to initialize attributes when an object is created.


### Object

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with specific **properties** (attributes) and **behaviours** (methods).
